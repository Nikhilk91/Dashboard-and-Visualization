#### The Purpose of Lab-5:
Develop a persuasive visualization for the prospective students, to show that MSIS program at Santa Clara University provides a better future career. This dashboard will help them take a decision on wether to join MSIS program or not. 
***

**Claim:** MSIS Program can provide a better future career

**Warrant:** 
1. The presence of large number of NASDAQ companies in California compared to Texas shows that the jobs opportunity at these tech firms are higher. 
* A student who is comparing MSIS at Santa Clara University with MSIS at UT Dallas (both have similar rankings) will be more clear about how the presence of more tech companies could be helpful for future career.

2. The fact that SCU graduates enter in different sectors such as 'Research', 'Tech Giants' and 'Leading Consultancies' shows that prospective students get an option to choose from different sectors and are not not restricted to any one particular.

3. The companrison between average salaries versus what Santa Clara University's graduate student earns shows that SCU graduates earn 10% more than the average salary of the country. This shows the program can help students fetch higher earning jobs.

**Backing:**  The data is used from payscale.com and nasdaq.com.

### Improvements in the Dashboard (For Lab-5):
***
**1.**  The visual created in Lab-5 shows comprehensive data, but lacks proper explanation and background.

**Improvement:** Add more details to the dashboard, eplaining to the user what each metric mean.

**2.** The lack of data to show the basis of calculation for the difference in number of companies and difference in the average salary and SCU graduates salary is missing.

**Improvement:** Add the graphs showing relevant data to the users. This adds more trust in the dashboard as it provides a solid base of calculation and not just the number.

### Take aways from Lab-8 Session are:

**Perception:**

* Adding information like 'Total number of breaches' and 'Total number of records stolen' can give users a better perception of data. Adding the absolute value to the visual could be of great importance in certain scenarios, helping users in understanding the actaul background of the scenario. This data when combined with comprehensive data helps users in taking a better decision.

**Comprehension:** 

* This data is more like averages or change in prices for intance. This is the data which shows a change. In this visual the change in the stock price is the comprehensive data. This type of data helps users in understanding due to certain event how the data changed. For instance in this visualization, due to the event of 'breach' how the stock prices were affected over a certain period of time. 

**Projection**

* This data is more about creating a "what-if analysis". This type of data represent a trend or a pattern in the data. Using this we try to project how the values could change according to the scenario. For instance in this particular visual, if we add a trend line showing the 'number of records stolen' vs 'the number of breaches/hacks' this would be an interesting trend to see. This will help users to estimate or project what could be the possible values in future. 
Although in this particular case we lack data to show any trend, so we are not including this section in the visual.

The above mentioned three types combined with a claim made in a visual helps users in taking a better decision.


**In Future -**
I could possible try to integrate it further into my old visualization and my redesigned version to give the student a better picture of the university. This would create a dashboard that would help the prospective student in learning both about the MSIS program in form of course tracks and skills that could be achieved and a comparison with other universities based on their preferences of ranking, student teacher ratio and acceptance rate of the university.
