## Lab Session-8 : MSIS Program can provide a better future career

#### Objectives: Redesign the visual created in lab session 5.
#### Date: 11-Nov-2017

#### Steps
* Critique your visualization
* Develop a roadmap for improvement
* Improve your visualization
* Explain how you have improved your visualization

#### The Purpose of Lab-5:
Develop a persuasive visualization for the prospective students, to show that MSIS program at Santa Clara University provides a better future career. This dashboard will help them take a decision on wether to join MSIS program or not. 
***

**Claim:** MSIS Program can provide a better future career

**Warrant:** 
1. The presence of large number of NASDAQ companies in California compared to Texas shows that the jobs opportunity at these tech firms are higher. 
* A student who is comparing MSIS at Santa Clara University with MSIS at UT Dallas (both have similar rankings) will be more clear about how the presence of more tech companies could be helpful for future career.

2. The fact that SCU graduates enter in different sectors such as 'Research', 'Tech Giants' and 'Leading Consultancies' shows that prospective students get an option to choose from different sectors and are not not restricted to any one particular.

3. The companrison between average salaries versus what Santa Clara University's graduate student earns shows that SCU graduates earn 10% more than the average salary of the country. This shows the program can help students fetch higher earning jobs.

**Backing:**  The data is used from payscale.com and nasdaq.com.

### Powerpoint Screenshot(s):

#### Before improvements (Lab-5)
**Advantages:**
* The users are identified correctly i.e. the prospective students.
* The dashboard is partially comprehensive.

**Disadvantages:**
* The visual created in Lab-5 shows comprehensive data, but lacks proper explanation and background.

**Improvement:** Added more details to the dashboard, eplaining to the user what each metric mean.

* The lack of data to show the basis of calculation for the difference in number of companies and difference in the average salary and SCU graduates salary is missing.

**Improvement:** Added the graphs showing relevant data to the users. This adds more trust in the dashboard as it provides a solid base of calculation and not just the number.

#### After improvements (Lab-8)
This visual gives a background to the users, enabling them to understand the purpose better and take a better decision.

**In Future -**
* Add metrics that can be integrated with my old visualization, to give the prospective students a greater insight of the visulization for better decision making.
* Add more comparisons based metrics, qualifier being 'Bay Area'. This will help them understand why Santa Clara University could possibly be the right option.

### Take aways from Lab-8 Session are:

**Perception:**

* Adding information like 'Total number of breaches' and 'Total number of records stolen' can give users a better perception of data. Adding the absolute value to the visual could be of great importance in certain scenarios, helping users in understanding the actaul background of the scenario. This data when combined with comprehensive data helps users in taking a better decision.

**Comprehension:** 

* This data is more like averages or change in prices for intance. This is the data which shows a change. In this visual the change in the stock price is the comprehensive data. This type of data helps users in understanding due to certain event how the data changed. For instance in this visualization, due to the event of 'breach' how the stock prices were affected over a certain period of time. 

**Projection**

* This data is more about creating a "what-if analysis". This type of data represent a trend or a pattern in the data. Using this we try to project how the values could change according to the scenario. For instance in this particular visual, if we add a trend line showing the 'number of records stolen' vs 'the number of breaches/hacks' this would be an interesting trend to see. This will help users to estimate or project what could be the possible values in future. 
Although in this particular case we lack data to show any trend, so we are not including this section in the visual.

The above mentioned three types combined with a claim made in a visual helps users in taking a better decision.
