###  About the Visual

**Claim:** MSIS Program can provide a better future career

**Warrant:** 
1. The presence of large number of NASDAQ companies in California compared to Texas shows that the jobs opportunity at these tech firms are higher. 
* A student who is comparing MSIS at Santa Clara University with MSIS at UT Dallas (both have similar rankings) will be more clear about how the presence of more tech companies could be helpful for future career.

2. The fact that SCU graduates enter in different sectors such as 'Research', 'Tech Giants' and 'Leading Consultancies' shows that prospective students get an option to choose from different sectors and are not not restricted to any one particular.

3. The companrison between average salaries versus what Santa Clara University's graduate student earns shows that SCU graduates earn 10% more than the average salary of the country. This shows the program can help students fetch higher earning jobs.

**Backing:**  The data is used from payscale.com and nasdaq.com.

### Powerpoint Screenshot(s):

#### Before improvements (Lab-5)
**Advantages:**
* The users are identified correctly i.e. the prospective students.
* The dashboard is partially comprehensive.

**Disadvantages:**
* The visual created in Lab-5 shows comprehensive data, but lacks proper explanation and background.

**Improvement:** Added more details to the dashboard, eplaining to the user what each metric mean.

* The lack of data to show the basis of calculation for the difference in number of companies and difference in the average salary and SCU graduates salary is missing.

**Improvement:** Added the graphs showing relevant data to the users. This adds more trust in the dashboard as it provides a solid base of calculation and not just the number.

#### After improvements (Lab-8)
This visual gives a background to the users, enabling them to understand the purpose better and take a better decision.

**Future Enhancements**
* Add metrics that can be integrated with my old visualization, to give the prospective students a greater insight of the visulization for better decision making.
* Add more comparisons based metrics, qualifier being 'Bay Area'. This will help them understand why Santa Clara University could possibly be the right option.

### Take aways from Lab-8 Session are:

**Audience:**

**Always check**
* Who is the targeted audience? 
* Is the visual created for the misunderstood audience?
* What is the actual need of the audience?

In this visualization, the audience is the **prospective students** and it is being correctly understood. The need of the audience is to get a dasbhboard, which can help them take a decision that should they go for MSIS program from the Santa Clara University or not. The improved dashboard solves the pupose. It gives prospective students the required background and also making the visual comprehensive by making comparisons.
****

**Metrics:**

**Always check**
* What is the goal of each metric?
* Is there a baseline created or needed?
* What all sources are being used?

In this Visualization, we have used metrics to compare the number of NASDAQ companies in California versus Texas. This is done to give users an idea that graduating from Santa Clara University could be advantageous compared to graduating from UT Dallas. This comparison is made as the two universities have the similar rankings and many international students consider both the universities for MSIS program.

The graph in the center shows that SCU graduates ends up in different sectors, showing that the different sectors welcome SCU graduates. Also, graduates can choose their career path according to their interest.

There is another comparison drawn between the salary earned by Santa Clara graduates versus the national average. This is done to help the user understand that graduating from Santa Clara University could help them earn in the future.

**Situational Awareness:**

* Perception
* Comprehension
* Projection

We need to make sure that the background is presented to the audience. The lack of background could make it difficult to understand the visual in completeness. This could also pose a challenge to the correctness of the visual.

There is also a need to know, is the audience trained? Will the audience be able to comprehend the visual without giving them much information on the visual. If not, add the information to the graph. 

The question arises, how much information? Would it become part of chart junk?

These questions are tricky to answer and could be well tackled with the following:
1. Experience
2. Know your audience well
3. Understand the needs, wants and fears of the users

In this visualization, you can see that the details are added towards the bottom of each metric (graph). This is done so that the users which in this case are prospective students should be able to comprehend the graphs.

The key here is to provide the **minimum required information to be able to comprehend** the visual to the users. This will help in avoid the addition of any chart junk.
