### I. Project statement (Motivation, objective, data, project plan)

### The *start* and the *motivation*
*What is a data product?*

Understanding what all a 'Data Product' encompasses is really essential for this project.
To answer this better, this youtube video helped us a lot. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuRINNSDtlM

A data product has several definitions. For this project, a data product is a set of visualizations put together to present a story to the audience which has an argument supported by those visualization.

Once we understood the requirement and expectations from this project, the team discussed the **5 W's**. The 5 W's are important because it helps us in analyzing what needs to be done, who will be the audience and what do they expect from this data product. This also helped us in coming up with a timeline to be followed for the project.

A qucik look at the **5 W's** we used:

* **Why**   - Why is this *Data Product needed*?
* **Who**   - Who will be the *audience*?
* **What**  - What is the *needs and wants* of the audience?
* **Where** - Where can we get the *relevant data* from?
* **When**  - By when this data is needed? 

*Note:* It doesn't matter how awesome a product is, it will be of no value if not delivered when it is needed. Sometimes a normal product works way better than an awesome product, it totally depends on the time of entry.

### Project plan:
1. To decide on a topic on which a 'Data Product' is to be made.
2. Analyze the data and come up with a possible story.
3. To come up with a claim (for the complete data product), with the selected data.
4. Decide on different metrics to be shown in the product.
4. To create a Minimal Viable Product.
5. Combine the data sets collected from different sources to create a single data set.
5. Make intermediate versions.
6. Analyze intermediate versions and find advantages and disadvantages of them.
7. Come up with the final Data Product.
8. Note down possible enhancements in the final version.
9. Create a video to present my visualization.

### Introduction: Corruption
Corruption is a form of dishonest or unethical conduct by a person entrusted with a position of authority, often to acquire personal benefit. Corruption may include many activities including bribery and embezzlement, though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries. Government, or 'political', corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain.

The unethical and often illegal nature of corruption makes measurement particularly complicated. Corruption data usually comes from either direct observation (e.g. law enforcement records and audit reports), or perception surveys (e.g. public opinion surveys, or expert assessments). In this project the data taken is from both sources.

**Corruption Perception Index and its importance in our analysis**

Transparency International (TI) has published the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) since 1996, annually ranking countries "by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys." The CPI generally defines corruption as "the misuse of public power for private benefit" 

**Economic implications**
"Research papers published in 2007 and 2008 examined the economic consequences of corruption perception, as defined by the CPI. The researchers found a correlation between a higher CPI and higher long-term economic growth, as well as an increase in GDP growth of 1.7% for every unit increase in a country's CPI score. Also shown was a power-law dependence linking higher CPI score to higher rates of foreign investment in a country."   *Source: Wikipedia*

In this project, we first validated how CPI relates with the reality. We compared CPI with the percentage of people who have actually bribed. This helped in proving that the CPI matches the reality. For further analysis on affects of corruption we used CPI as a metric.

We analyzed how corruption can hinder the Human Development by creating a visualization between HDI and CPI. This helped us in understanding that Human Development is lower in countries where corruption is more. 

Further analyzed how deep rooted are the effects of corruption on a country's **GDP** and how it affects the **Foreign Direct Investment**.

In this project we also added a possible solution to the problem of Corruption and that is **Education**. The message to all the countries is - 'educate your people to eradicate corruption'.

### What is the relationship between corruption and development?
The following visualization shows the cross-country relationship between development (as measured by the United Nations Human Development Index) and corruption (as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index).

As we can see, countries that score higher in the Corruption Perception Index (i.e. countries seen as less corrupt) tend to also have better scores in the Human Development Index.

### IV.	Final Data Product:
Visualization 1: Perception matches Reality

This visualization is to validate how CPI relates with the reality. The comparison of CPI with the percentage of people who have actually bribed is matching. For further analysis on affects of corruption we used CPI as a metric as this can be considered a good parameter to be used as it matches with the reality. The CPI correctly shows the level of corruption in different countries.

**Advantages:** This visual enables the audience to easily see how Corruption Perception Index is realted to the reality. The visual shows a relationship between the CPI and the share of people who have bribed (in percentage)  for the year 2013. 

We have kept the visualization in the same format. All the visualizations are of type **scatter plot** as we had a large set of countries and it make sense to analyze data using a scatter plot. It is easy to see the trend corruption is following if the data is grouped on the basis of **Continents**. The x-axis has been kept consistent throughout so that the user doesn't have to put in a lot of time and effort to understand each visual.

**Disadvantage:**

1. The problem of unnecessary data on one chart persists.
2. Claim could not be supported by this chart.

### V. About the final Data Product
This Data product is a set of several visualization and covers the topic of **Corruption**, its affects and its causes.
In this project the team has created several visuals to represent how different countries are perceived on the parameter of corruption and where they actually lies in reality using the parameter 'percentage of people who actually bribed' in the country. 

Then the second visualization shows how the corruption has been affecting the Human development. This a graph showing Human Development Index and Corruption Perception Index.


--------
This visual presents a great insight regarding the problem of corruption. It can be easily observed that the problem of corruption is greater in the region of Asia, Africa and South America. It can be concluded from this visualization that corruption is a problem of a region. It could be possible that corruption gets spreaded to the neighbouring countries and it perceived to be normal in the particular region as most of the countries in these region faces this problem. It would take further analysis and is out of scope of this project, to check wether the problem of corruption has spread from one country to another over the period of time.
--------

### V.	Road map with future features/enhancements
* Add analysis, to check why and how corruption became prevelant in certain areas of the world.
* Analyze the possible effect of erradicating corruption from a country. Although corruption is assumed to be a problem and a factor hindering growth, but it could potentially be needed in certain countries for the purpose of business and a smooth functioning of government bodies. In these countries corruption might be playing a vital role in growth of GDP.
* Further analysis could be done to add more solution to this problem.
