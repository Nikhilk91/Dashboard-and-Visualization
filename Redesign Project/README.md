### I.	Project statement (Motivation, objective, data, project plan)
I am redesigning the visualization which is present on the site: http://www.informationisbeautiful.net .
The visualization I would be redesigning is http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/caffeine-and-calories/

**The motivation behind this redesign is:**

1. To reduce the chart junk that is data pixels over visualization pixels.
2. To remove any element of a chart that does not contribute towards the claim.
3. Try to redesign this visual with a cognitive approach.

**Project plan:**

1.	To identify the claim, to be made by the visual. 
2.	To come up with the MVP.
3.	Data Identification and extraction.
4.	Make intermediate versions.
5.	Analyze intermediate versions and find advantages and disadvantages of them.
6.	Come up with the final visual.
7.	Note down possible enhancements in the final version.
8.	Create a video to present my visualization.

**This is the screenshot of the visualization I shall be re-designing:**
