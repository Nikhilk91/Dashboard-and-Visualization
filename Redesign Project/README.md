### I.	Project statement (Motivation, objective, data, project plan)
I am redesigning the visualization which is present on the site: http://www.informationisbeautiful.net .
The visualization I would be redesigning is http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/caffeine-and-calories/

**The motivation behind this redesign is:**

1. To reduce the chart junk that is data pixels over visualization pixels.
2. To remove any element of a chart that does not contribute towards the claim.
3. Try to redesign this visual with a cognitive approach.

**Project plan:**

1.	To identify the claim, to be made by the visual. 
2.	To come up with the MVP.
3.	Data Identification and extraction.
4.	Make intermediate versions.
5.	Analyze intermediate versions and find advantages and disadvantages of them.
6.	Come up with the final visual.
7.	Note down possible enhancements in the final version.
8.	Create a video to present my visualization.

**This is the screenshot of the visualization I shall be re-designing:**

### II. 	“Making-of” documentation (Details of your development process, data wrangling steps, your reasoning, detours, literature, etc.)

### III.	Several intermediate visualization prototypes (This section encompasses detailed “Making-of” and Intermediate Visuals)

**Day 1:**

* **Activity 1:** Went through different visualizations available on the site http://www.informationisbeautiful.net . After analysis selected the visualization I would like to redesign. I selected the specific visual because I could see the way it can be improved or modified to make it more presentable with lesser chart junk.
***
**Day 2:**

* **Activity 1:** Had a discussion with the professor regarding the visualization I selected. 
Meeting output: Some insights from the professor. Ideas on how the visualization can be improved or better represented (Ideas which I cannot use now).

* **Activity 2:** Drafted project statement and created a project plan. Started working on “Making-of” document.

* **Activity 3:** Deciding on the purpose of the visual, the claim and the audience.
***
**Day 3: **
* **Activity 1:** Searching the data which could give me a relationship between the number of calories burned by playing a sport for different hours.
Relevant data found on: http://www.nutristrategy.com/caloriesburned.htm
    1.	Copying the data into an excel for MVP.
    2.	Later, I will try to do the same using beautiful soup.
    
* **Activity 2:** Joining the dataset (Fig 1.) to play with data in Tableau.
