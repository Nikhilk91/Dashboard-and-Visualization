### I.	Project statement (Motivation, objective, data, project plan)
This project is to show how the visualization can deceive the audience. In this project, there will be two visualization. These will be created from the same data sets and one will counterclaim the other. This rebuttal of claims shows that the data could be presented in a certain way to deceive the audience.

**The motivation behind this redesign is:**
Now-a-days, data visualization is becoming one powerful communication tool. These visualization can be used to support arguments in different ways that can be engaging and accessible.
We can see a huge rise in the popularity of data visualization over the past decade. Different people are coming up with their own charts and visuals, which could be a good thing. But, this in turn also poses a unique problem. Despite the availability of some great charting resources, we are witnessing an influx of poorly-designed misleading  or downright deceptive data visualization.
This visualization is to prove the point just mentioned above. With this project, I will try to deceive my audience to make a point, visuals created should be well backed by data and proofs.


**Data Source:** https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/ghg-reporting-program-data-sets

This data is about the Greenhouse Gas emissions from various sectors.

**Project plan:**
This project will be based on exploration rather than confirmation.

1.	To identify the data, to be used to create a deceptive visual. 
2.	To come up with a claim, with the selected data.
3.  To create a MVP.  
4.  Find the data that refutes my claim.
5.	Make intermediate versions.
6.	Analyze intermediate versions and find advantages and disadvantages of them.
7.	Come up with the final visual.
8.	Note down possible enhancements in the final version.
9.	Create a video to present my visualization.

### III.	Several intermediate visualization prototypes (This section encompasses detailed “Making-of” and Intermediate Visuals)
**Day 1:**

* **Activity 1:** Studying and analyzing different visualization and data sets available online. After analysis, selected the data set/topic on which deception visualization will be created.
![ScreenShot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32223677/33045757-c9b7653c-ce02-11e7-92de-a8258991ff33.png)
Fig. 1

*Background:* In the US, Methane emissions from livestock are not reported. The data set selected shows the reported Greenhouse Gas emissions by different sector. This made the topic interesting and intrigued me to take a deeper look into it.

**Day 2:**

* **Activity 1:** Had a discussion with the professor regarding the data set/topic I selected. 
*Meeting output:* The topic seemed promising and worth a deeper analysis.

* **Activity 2:** Drafted project statement and created a project plan. Started working on “Making-of” document.
***

**Day 3:**

* **Activity 1:** Deciding on the parameters for the visual, the claim and the audience. 

**Data Source:** https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/ghg-reporting-program-data-sets

***

**Day 4:**

* **Activity 1:** Analyzing the data needed to represent the counterclaim. Any data which could show that Methane causes damage to the climate and we should make a check on its emission and sources could be helpful in this rebuttal. 

**Data selected for counterclaim:**

* Link1: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/29/methane-emissions-cattle-11-percent-higher-than-estimated

Link1 tells that the currently the methane emissions are under evaluated and the numbers could be 11% higher than the estimated value.

* Link2: https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases

Link2 shows that methane has 25-100 times more efficient in trapping radiations compared to CO2 over the period of 100 years.

* **Activity 2:** Joining the dataset to play with data in Tableau. This will help in analysis and creating a MVP.

***
**Day 5:**

* **Activity 1:** Creating a MVP and discussing results with the professor. This will help in understanding and identifying the needs, wants and possible fears of the user at an early stage.
Advantages:

1. This visual shows the level of Greenhouse Gases emissions for few states based on their different sources.

Disadvantage:

1. Too much data on one chart.
2. Hard to make a claim.

Fig. 3

Advantages:

1. In this visual, different GHG emissions sources are clubbed together to make fewer sectors.
2. This makes it easier to read.

Disadvantage:

1. The problem of unnecessary data on one chart persists.
2. Claim could not be supported by this chart.

Fig. 4

* **Activity 2:** Analyzing the data sets and selected 2 states 'Nebraska' and 'Kansas' to be shown on the Visualization. These states are taken as these are amongst the top 3 states in the US with respect to the population of livestock. Even though they have large livestock population, from the visual 1 it can be seen that the contribution of Methane emissions is very less compared to the reported Greenhouse Gases. Methane emissions from livestock accounts for **only 1.3%** which is significantly less. We can infer from the visualization that this type of emission is not posing any serious concern and it is ok not to account them.


* **Activity 3:** Read different articles and research paper to analyze how the Methane emissions from livestock could be calculated. 
* **Research paper 1:** https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/conference/ei12/green/mangino.pdf

![ScreenShot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32223677/33045996-efc1f4d0-ce03-11e7-942d-33a4f42a0ac5.png)
Fig. 5

A very informative and well written paper by *Joseph Mangino*, *Katrin Peterson and Hannah Jacobs*. This research paper helped in understanding different factors taken into consideration to calulate the methane emissions from livestock.

This process is not simple. The emissions depends on different factors such as the following:

* Weight of the animal
* Feed of the animal
* Type of digestive system

***
**Day 6:**
* **Activity 1:** Modifying the claim according to the findings in the data set. The approach has been changed a bit from what was envisioned initially.

Advantages:

1. The number of states are further reduced to make a claim on the basis of comparison between emissions from Kansas and Nebraska vs. Ohio

Disadvantage:

1. Could not be used as the data came out to be different from expected.

![ScreenShot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32223677/32994491-e4b58bfc-cd1c-11e7-840c-45ade523d0ff.png)
Fig. 6

Initial idea was to show that Greenhouse gas emissions from two states combined together is less than Ohio. And to counterclaim, the effect of methane will be added and then the combined result will be higher than the Ohio's GHG emissions.
But, after analysis and findings, this was not the case. The methane emissions by measure is not significant when compare to the reported emissions.

![ScreenShot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32223677/33046497-084463c4-ce06-11e7-85c0-8d8a5a0c93f1.png)

Later, the idea was changed to show that methane emissions from livestock are insignificant compared to total reported emissions. Counterclaim for the same would be that methane emissions are very high on severity compared to CO2. This shows that they have a significant on the climate and should be accounted while calculating the toatal GHG emissions. Also, there should be steps to mitigate the challenges posed by methane.

* **Activity 2:** The Visualization is modified according to the above explanation. This helps in understanding the effect of Methane emissions better. Also, the visual creates a sense of awareness that neglecting the methane emissions is not the right approach.
***

**Day 7:**
* **Activity 1:** Checking for situational awareness. Adding background details to the visual. The information such as the population of livestock in the states Nebraska and Kansas, also the information such as their ranking in the US in terms of livestock population will help the audience understand the visualization better. These details make the dashboard more **comprehensive**.

* Article used: http://beef2live.com/story-cattle-inventory-state-rankings-89-108182

Note: There is no projection in this visualization.

* **Activity 2:** Calculating the methane emission from the livestock based on the article: http://www.pnas.org/content/111/14/E1320.full

Note: The calculations done will not be the exact value of methane emission. These are estimated based on the article mentioned above. The values used are just to spread the awareness/effect of methane emissions in the US.

* **Activity 3:** **Beautification** of the visual. Clubbed the different sectors under *'Reported'* and *'Unreported'* to be used in the pie chart. The pie chart is added to give a background that Methane emissions are merely 1.3% of the total emissions. This shows not reporting them makes sense as the numbers are insignificant when seen as a whole.
***

**Day 8:** 
* **Activity 1:** Discussed the progress with the professor and the possible changes in the visualization to make it better.

**Outcome of meeting:** To show severity of Methane compared to CO2 instead of converting the emissions based on the severity and adding to the total value.

### IV.	Final data visualization:
**Visual 1: Methane Emissions from livestocks do not pose a significant threat on climate** 
![ScreenShot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32223677/33000636-30096ea2-cd5e-11e7-93ae-c32c20d6a99a.png)

**Visual 2: Methane emissions from livestock poses a serious threat on climate** 
![ScreenShot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32223677/33000643-3c135582-cd5e-11e7-8910-90cd64a2900c.png)

### V. About the final visual

**Description:** 
The visualization 1 shows that Methane emissions are insignificant compared to total reported GHG emissions. Therefore, it doesn't create an issue to be worried about. Also, it is fine to not report these emissions are these are very less. 

The visualization 2 presents a counterclaim to the visualization 1. In this we can see that Methane emissions although very less compared to CO2 emissions has very high severity. 

**"The comparative impact of CH4 is approximately 25-100 times greater than CO2 over a 100-year period."**

-- **Source:** https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases

The visual 2 leaves the visual 1 to be deceptive. As the visual 2 calims that we should not be worried about the Methane emissions from livestock. But, by showing the severity of these emissions in visual 2 the claim in visual 1 losses its integrity.

**Claim:**
* **Visualization 1:** Methane Emissions from livestocks do not pose a significant threat on climate.
* **Visualization 2:** Methane emissions from livestock poses a serious threat on climate

**Warrant:**
Multiple researches done on the emissions show that methane is highly severe compared to CO2 emissions when it comes to trapping the radiations.

**Backing:**
* **Article1:** https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases

This article by *'United States Environmental Protection Agency'* explains the profound effect of Methane over CO2 over the period of 100 years.

* **Article2:** https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/29/methane-emissions-cattle-11-percent-higher-than-estimated

This article ddescribes that we are already underestimating the amount of Methane emissions from the livestock.

**Qualifier:** 
* These emissions are calculated for only two states i.e. 'Kansas' and 'Nebraska' in the United States.

### V.	Road map with future features/enhancements
Interestingly in this Visualization we could do some predictions on the future level of Methane emissions. This could be done with the use of changing livestock population over the years and with that the changing values of methane emissions. A trend line could help show what could be the future trend/values could be.

### Additional Information
***

### VI.	Assumption(s)

1. We used US Department of Agriculture-National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA-NASS) livestock inventory estimates for 2013 (www.nass.usda.gov) and methane emission rates per unit of feed dry matter intake from two large datasets [Hristov et al. (2) and Hales et al. (3)] to estimate total methane emission from enteric fermentation for the United States.

2. The current livestock methane generated is calculated by using the values of per head meathane produced by livestock in 2013.

3. Contributions to methane emissions by other ruminants or nonruminant herbivores (sheep, goats, wild ruminants, horses, and so forth) are small in the United States and were not included in this analysis
