### I.	Project statement (Motivation, objective, data, project plan)
This project is to show how the visualization can deceive the audience. In this project, there will be two visualization. These will be created from the same data sets and one will counterclaim the other. This rebuttal of claims shows that the data could be presented in a certain way to deceive the audience.

**The motivation behind this redesign is:**
Now-a-days, data visualization is becoming one powerful communication tool. These visualization can be used to support arguments in different ways that can be engaging and accessible.
We can see a huge rise in the popularity of data visualization over the past decade. Different people are coming up with their own charts and visuals, which could be a good thing. But, this in turn also poses a unique problem. Despite the availability of some great charting resources, we are witnessing an influx of poorly-designed misleading  or downright deceptive data visualization.
This visualization is to prove the point just mentioned above. With this project, I will try to deceive my audience to make a point, visuals created should be well backed by data and proofs.


**Data Source:** https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/ghg-reporting-program-data-sets

This data is about the Greenhouse Gas emissions from various sectors.

**Project plan:**
This project will be based on exploration rather than confirmation.

1.	To identify the data, to be used to create a deceptive visual. 
2.	To come up with a claim, with the selected data.
3.  To create a MVP.  
4.  Find the data that refutes my claim.
5.	Make intermediate versions.
6.	Analyze intermediate versions and find advantages and disadvantages of them.
7.	Come up with the final visual.
8.	Note down possible enhancements in the final version.
9.	Create a video to present my visualization.
