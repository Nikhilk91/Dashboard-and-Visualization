### I.	Project statement (Motivation, objective, data, project plan)

**The motivation behind this redesign is:**
Now-a-days, data visualization is becoming one powerful communication tool. These visualizations can be used to support arguments in different ways that can be engaging and accesible.
We can see a huge rise in the popularity of data visualization over the past decade. Different people are coming up with their own charts and visuals, which could be a good thing. But, this in turn also poses a unique problem. Despite the availability of some great charting resources, we are witnessing an influx of poorly-designed misleading  or downright deceptive data visualizations.
This visualization is to prove the point just mentioned above. With this project, I will try to decieve my audience to make a point, visuals created should be well backed by data and proofs.

**Project plan:**
This project will be based on exploration rather than confirmation.

1.	To identify the data, to be used to create a deceptive visual. 
2.	To come up with a claim, with the selected data.
3.  To create a MVP.  
4.  Find the data that refutes my claim.
5.	Make intermediate versions.
6.	Analyze intermediate versions and find advantages and disadvantages of them.
7.	Come up with the final visual.
8.	Note down possible enhancements in the final version.
9.	Create a video to present my visualization.

### II. 	“Making-of” documentation (Details of your development process, data wrangling steps, your reasoning, detours, literature, etc.)

### III.	Several intermediate visualization prototypes (This section encompasses detailed “Making-of” and Intermediate Visuals)

### IV.	Final data visualization:
