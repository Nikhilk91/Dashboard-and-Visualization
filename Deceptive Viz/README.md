### I.	Project statement (Motivation, objective, data, project plan)
Now-a-days, data visualization is becoming one powerful communication tool. These visualizations can be used to support arguments in different ways that can be engaging and accesible.
We can see a huge rise in the popularity of data visualization over the past decade. Different people are coming up with their own charts and visuals, which could be a good thing. But, this in turn also poses a unique problem. Despite the availability of some great charting resources, we are witnessing an influx of poorly-designed misleading  or downright deceptive data visualizations.
This visualization is to prove the point just mentioned above. With this project, I will try to decieve my audience to make a point, visuals created should be well backed by data and proofs.

**The motivation behind this redesign is:**

1. To reduce the chart junk that is data pixels over visualization pixels.
2. To remove any element of a chart that does not contribute towards the claim.
3. Try to redesign this visual with a cognitive approach.

**Project plan:**

1.	To identify the claim, to be made by the visual. 
2.	To come up with the MVP.
3.	Data Identification and extraction.
4.	Make intermediate versions.
5.	Analyze intermediate versions and find advantages and disadvantages of them.
6.	Come up with the final visual.
7.	Note down possible enhancements in the final version.
8.	Create a video to present my visualization.
